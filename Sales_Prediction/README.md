# Sales Prediction Model

## Overview
Welcome to the Sales Prediction Model repository! In this project, I have built a predictive model to forecast sales using three different regression algorithms: RandomForest Regressor, XGBoost Regressor, and Linear Regression. Each of these models has been fine-tuned to achieve a low mean squared error, ensuring accurate sales predictions.

## Introduction
Predicting sales is crucial for businesses to make informed decisions regarding inventory management, resource allocation, and overall business strategy. This project aims to develop an accurate sales prediction model using various regression algorithms.

## Models Used
### 1. RandomForest Regressor
RandomForest Regressor is an ensemble learning method that constructs a multitude of decision trees during training and outputs the mean prediction of the individual trees. It is effective in handling large datasets with high dimensionality.

### 2. XGBoost Regressor
XGBoost Regressor is an optimized distributed gradient boosting library designed for efficient and flexible machine learning. It uses a gradient boosting framework and incorporates regularization to prevent overfitting, making it robust and accurate for regression tasks.

### 3. Linear Regression
Linear Regression is a simple yet powerful regression algorithm that models the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables by fitting a linear equation to the observed data. It is particularly useful for interpreting the relationships between variables.

## Usage
To use the sales prediction model, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your_username/sales-prediction-model.git
cd sales-prediction-model
```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   Scikit-Learn
   Numpy
   Pandas
   Seaborn


4. Run the model script:
```bash
python predict_sales.py
```

4. Input the relevant features such as historical sales data, marketing spend, seasonality factors, etc., when prompted.

5. The model will output the predicted sales based on the selected algorithm (RandomForest Regressor, XGBoost Regressor, or Linear Regression).
